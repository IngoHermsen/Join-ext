Kanban-Based Task Manager with small firestore backend.

Features:

- User authentication management with Registration and "Forgot Password" process.
- add other users e.g. colleagues or friends as contacts for collaboration.
- Create your own projects which include tasks as draggable cards.
- Create, edit, or delete tasks for your own project or another project you are part of.

- Change the process state of tasks by dragging and dropping between the four possible task states:
  - todo
  - in Progress
  - in Review
  - done
  
- Keep control about your anonymity by changing your account to public or private state as you want.
  Only if you have chosen a public state you can be found as contact and assigned to tasks by other users.
